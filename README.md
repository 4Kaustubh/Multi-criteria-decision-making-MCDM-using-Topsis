# Multi-criteria-decision-making-MCDM-using-Topsis
Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a branch of operations research that deals with decision-making problems involving multiple conflicting criteria or objectives. TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a widely used MCDM method for solving multi-criteria decision-making problems.

TOPSIS is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest Euclidean distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution. The positive ideal solution is a hypothetical solution that maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the cost criteria, while the negative ideal solution is the opposite, minimizing the benefit criteria and maximizing the cost criteria.

The TOPSIS method follows these general steps:

1. Construct a decision matrix: This matrix contains the performance ratings of each alternative against each criterion.

2. Normalize the decision matrix: The values in the decision matrix are normalized to eliminate the influence of different units and scales.

3. Calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix: Each normalized value is multiplied by the corresponding weight of the criterion, reflecting its relative importance.

4. Determine the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution: The positive ideal solution is the set of maximum values in the weighted normalized decision matrix for benefit criteria and minimum values for cost criteria. The negative ideal solution is the opposite.

5. Calculate the separation measures: The Euclidean distances of each alternative from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution are calculated.

6. Determine the relative closeness to the ideal solution: For each alternative, the relative closeness to the ideal solution is calculated, which is the ratio of its separation from the negative ideal solution to the sum of its separations from both ideal solutions.

7. Rank the alternatives: The alternatives are ranked in descending order based on their relative closeness to the ideal solution. The alternative with the highest value is considered the best choice.

TOPSIS is widely used in various fields, such as supply chain management, project selection, location selection, and product design, among others. It provides a systematic and objective approach to evaluating and ranking alternatives based on multiple conflicting criteria, making it a valuable tool for decision-makers.
